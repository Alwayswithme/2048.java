### Development ###

some ideas behind the game.

* Tiles are drawn by java.awt.Graphics.
* Single dimensional arrays to simulate coordinate system. tiles[x + y * 4] get the tile in (x, y)
* A movements just move all the tile to one side, then merge it ASAP.
* The movements to different side is using rotate to do so.


### Requirements ###

* OpenJDK-7 or newer to compile and run

```Shell
>  $ cd 2048.java; mkdir bin
>  $ javac -d bin src/phx/*       # compile
>  $ java -cp bin phx.GUI2048     # enjoy
```
